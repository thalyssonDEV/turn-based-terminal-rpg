# Turn-Based Terminal RPG

**Description**  
This is a **turn-based RPG** project, developed in **TypeScript**, that provides a gameplay experience exclusively in the terminal. The player has the opportunity to choose a character class and engage in strategic turn-based battles until a single player is declared the winner.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Programming language used for game development.  
- **Node.js**: JavaScript/TypeScript runtime environment for the terminal.  
- **OOP Concepts**: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.

##  Features

- **Character Class Selection**: The player can choose from a variety of character classes. Each class has unique abilities.
- **Turn-based Combat System**: The game follows the classic turn-based combat model, where each character and enemy take turns making moves.
- **OOP in the Game**: The game was designed using OOP principles:
  - **Encapsulation**: Attributes and methods of each character are encapsulated within their respective classes.
  - **Inheritance**: Character classes inherit behaviors from base classes, allowing for better code reuse.
  - **Polymorphism**: Combat methods can be polymorphic, with different behaviors depending on the character class.
- **Terminal Interactivity**: The game is played entirely in the terminal, with options to select actions, view information about characters and enemies, and track the progress of the combat.
